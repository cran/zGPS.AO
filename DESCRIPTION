Description: The method zGPS.AO (Zero Inflated Gamma Poisson Shrinker with AE 
    (Adverse Event) ontology) is based on the zero-inflated negative binomial 
    distribution. 
    It estimates the association between a specific vaccine and an adverse event 
    group, as well as associations between that vaccine and individual adverse 
    events within the adverse event group. This model handles the adverse event 
    count data with excess zeros and over-dispersion, and it allows borrowing 
    information from adverse event data in the same group. Details can be found 
    in  "Data Mining in Large Frequency Tables With Ontology, with an Application 
    to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System."
